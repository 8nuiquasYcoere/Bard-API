The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 applies to all judicial proceedings in or before any court, including a court martial, a tribunal or other authority exercising judicial or quasi-judicial powers or jurisdiction. However, it does not apply to proceedings before an arbitrator[^1^].
 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 consists of two parts and eleven chapters. The first part deals with the relevancy of facts, admissions, estoppel, witnesses, documentary evidence and oral evidence. The second part deals with facts which need not be proved, presumptions, estoppel, burden of proof and examination of witnesses[^1^].
 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 is based on the principles of Islamic jurisprudence and aims to ensure justice, fairness and equity in the administration of evidence. It also seeks to protect the rights and dignity of witnesses and parties to a case[^2^].
 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 is available in both Urdu and English languages. It can be downloaded for free from various online sources[^3^] [^4^]. However, it is advisable to consult a legal expert before relying on any online version of the law.
  
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 defines various terms and concepts related to the law of evidence, such as fact, fact-in-issue, relevant fact, admission, confession, estoppel, witness, oath, affirmation, documentary evidence, oral evidence, primary evidence, secondary evidence, hearsay evidence, expert evidence and judicial notice.
 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 also lays down the rules and conditions for the admissibility and weight of different types of evidence. For example, it states that evidence may be given of facts-in-issue and relevant facts, but not of irrelevant or immaterial facts. It also states that admissions and confessions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes them, but not in his favor. It also states that a person who is bound by an estoppel cannot deny the truth of any statement or fact which he has previously admitted or asserted. It also states that a witness is a person who gives oral or documentary evidence in a judicial proceeding. It also states that documentary evidence is superior to oral evidence and primary evidence is superior to secondary evidence. It also states that hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible, except in certain cases. It also states that expert evidence is admissible when the court has to form an opinion on a point of science, art or foreign law. It also states that the court must take judicial notice of certain facts which are so notorious or well-known that they do not require proof.
 
The Qanun-e-Shahadat Order 1984 also provides the guidelines and procedures for the examination and cross-examination of witnesses. For example, it states that the court has the power to decide when a question shall be asked and when a witness shall be compelled to answer. It also states that a question should not be asked without reasonable grounds and that the court may disallow any question which is indecent, scandalous or irrelevant. It also states that a witness may be cross-examined by the adverse party on any matter relevant to the case. It also states that a witness may be impeached or corroborated by other evidence. It also states that a witness may refresh his memory by referring to any document or thing while giving his testimony.
