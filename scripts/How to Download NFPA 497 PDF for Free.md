# How to Download NFPA 497 PDF for Free
 
NFPA 497 is a recommended practice for the classification of flammable liquids, gases, or vapors and of hazardous (classified) locations for electrical installations in chemical process areas. It provides criteria to determine ignitability hazards and to select appropriate electrical systems and equipment for safe use in Class I hazardous (classified) locations.

If you are looking for a free copy of NFPA 497 PDF, you may be disappointed to know that it is not available for download or printing from the official website of NFPA. NFPA relies on the revenues from the sale of its codes and standards to fund its mission of enhancing public safety. Therefore, it does not allow users to download or print its documents for free.
 
However, NFPA does offer free online access to its codes and standards for public viewing. You can view NFPA 497 online by following these steps:
 
1. Go to [https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=497](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=497)
2. Select the link of the code/standard # (first column).
3. Once on the specific page, click the "Free Access" button located under the title.
4. Use the drop-down menu to select an available edition.
5. Select the "view" button.
6. A new browser window will open displaying terms & conditions. Review and accept the agreement term to view the publication.
7. Use the "Table of Contents" or paging buttons to view chapters/sections.
8. Use the Zoom feature to increase/decrease the font size.

Please note: You will be asked to "sign-in" or create a profile to access NFPA codes/standards.
 
While this method does not allow you to download or print NFPA 497 PDF for free, it does give you a chance to familiarize yourself with the content and requirements of the document. You can also use this method to access other NFPA codes and standards for free online.

NFPA 497 is based on the principle that flammable gases or vapors, flammable liquids, or combustible liquids can form explosive mixtures with air under certain conditions of temperature and pressure. These conditions are influenced by factors such as the type and concentration of the flammable material, the presence of ignition sources, the ventilation rate, and the geometry of the space. NFPA 497 provides guidance on how to classify these hazardous (classified) locations into different zones or divisions based on the likelihood and duration of the presence of an explosive atmosphere.
 
NFPA 497 also provides guidance on how to select electrical systems and equipment that are suitable for use in Class I hazardous (classified) locations. Electrical systems and equipment can be a potential source of ignition if they produce sparks, arcs, or high temperatures that can ignite an explosive mixture. NFPA 497 specifies the types and ratings of electrical systems and equipment that are permitted in each zone or division, as well as the installation and maintenance requirements to ensure their safe operation.
 
NFPA 497 is intended to be used in conjunction with other NFPA codes and standards that address specific aspects of fire and explosion prevention, protection, and mitigation in chemical process areas. Some of these codes and standards include NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code; NFPA 70, National Electrical Code; NFPA 77, Recommended Practice on Static Electricity; NFPA 780, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems; and NFPA 2001, Standard on Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems.
