The first thing you need to do is to download a file called **Prototype 2 DLC Unlocker-3DM**. This file is a crack that can bypass the game's security and enable you to access the hidden content. You can find this file on various websites, such as [CashShare](http://www.cashshare.org/download/2487/-Prototype.2.DLC.Unlocker-3DM.rar) [^3^]. You should scan the file for viruses before opening it.
 
After downloading the file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called **Radnet\_DLC**. This folder contains the files for the Radnet DLC, which is a set of challenges and rewards that you can access from the main menu of the game. To install the Radnet DLC, you need to copy the folder and paste it into your game directory. The game directory is usually located at **C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Prototype 2**.
 
Once you have copied the folder, you can start your game and enjoy the Radnet DLC. You will see a new option called **RADNET Access** on the main menu. From there, you can select different events and missions that will test your skills and abilities. You can also unlock new skins, mutations, and powers by completing these challenges.
 
Another way to unlock skins and DLCs in Prototype 2 is to use a save file that has 100% completion. This means that the save file has already finished all the missions, collected all the collectibles, and unlocked all the achievements in the game. By using this save file, you can access all the skins and DLCs without having to do anything else. You can find such a save file on various websites, such as [MediaFire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/540h2a4w0j0w0w5/Prototype_2_Savedata_100%25.rar/file) [^1^]. You should scan the file for viruses before opening it.
 
After downloading the file, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called **Prototype 2 Savedata 100%**. This folder contains the files for the save data. To use this save data, you need to copy the folder and paste it into your save directory. The save directory is usually located at **C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\SKIDROW\SKIDROW\209100\Storage**.
 
Once you have copied the folder, you can start your game and load the save file. You will see that you have all the skins and DLCs unlocked in your inventory. You can change your skin from the pause menu by selecting **Skins**. You can also access other DLCs from the main menu or from your map.
 
That's how you can unlock all skins and DLCs in Prototype 2 using two different methods. You can choose whichever method suits you best or try both of them. However, you should be careful when downloading files from unknown sources, as they may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or your game. You should also backup your original files before replacing them with new ones, in case something goes wrong.
